Writing your First OpenStack Application
****************************************

This repo contains little random code snippets that could be
useful when preparing the "Writing your First OpenStack Application"
tutorial.

So far we have a basic message queue writer (sensor.py) and consumer
(backend.py). They'll just write and read random numbers using a queue.


Needs pika to run.
